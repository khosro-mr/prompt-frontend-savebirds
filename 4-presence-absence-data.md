<h1 align="center">SaveBirds.app Presence-Absence Data Page</h1>

# 1. Overview
Create the Presence-Absence Data page for SaveBirds.app using Vue 3 and Bootstrap 5. This page allows users to select a specific bird species and time range to visualize where that species has been observed across North America.

# 2. Design Requirements

## 2.1. Layout Structure
The Presence-Absence Data page should consist of three main sections:
- **Explanation Section**: Title and descriptive text explaining the feature
- **Form and Results Section**: User input controls and resulting map display
- **Bird Image Recovery Panel**: Dynamic bird image search results

## 2.2. Visual Reference

    style="width: 100%; height: 700px"
    class="border">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

# 4. Data Requirements

## 4.1. Species List for Dropdown
- Comprehensive list of North American bird species
- Each entry should include:
  - Species common name (e.g., "Bald Eagle")
  - Corresponding AOU code (e.g., 3520)
- Implement as a searchable dropdown using v-select component
- Data structure:
  - options: Array of species names
  - aou: Object mapping species names to AOU codes

## 4.2. Form Data Handling
- Implement v-model bindings for all form inputs:
  - startYear: Selected start year
  - endYear: Selected end year
  - name: Selected species name
- Derive AOU code from the selected species name
- Handle form submission with @submit.prevent directive
- Implement appropriate validation before submission

# 5. Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop View**:
  - Two-column layout with form on left, image search on right
  - Balanced spacing between elements
  - Full-width map result below form inputs

- **Mobile View**:
  - Single-column layout with sections stacked vertically
  - Form inputs should be properly sized for mobile viewing
  - Bird image search panel should appear below form
  - All interactive elements sized appropriately for touch input

# 6. Implementation Notes
- Create as a Vue component in `views/PresenceAbsenceView.vue`
- Use Bootstrap 5 grid system for responsive layout
- Implement form controls using Vue's v-model for data binding
- Use v-select component for the searchable species dropdown
- Handle the three possible states of the form:
  - Initial/Error (status === 0)
  - Success with results (status === 1)
  - Processing (status === 2)
- Since this is a frontend-only implementation, mock the API responses with static examples
- Implement proper error handling for form submission

# 7. Component Data Structure
```javascript
data() {
  return {
    fixStartYear: 1966,
    rangeFixed: 55, // Adjust based on current year
    range: 55,      // Dynamically calculated based on startYear
    helper: 0,      // Used for end year calculation
    startYear: 1966,
    endYear: 2022,  // Update to current year
    name: "",       // Selected species name
    options: [],    // Will be populated with species list
    aou: {},        // Will be populated with species:AOU mapping
    status: 0,      // 0: initial/error, 1: success, 2: processing
    failed: "Please select a species name.",
    wait: "Processing your request, please wait...",
    is_default: false,
    png: "",
    zip: "",
    baseURL: "" // Base URL for API calls
  }
}
```

# 8. Code Structure
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<section>`, `<form>`, etc.)
- Implement as a single-file component with template, script, and style sections
- Style using Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS
- For any custom styles, use scoped CSS to avoid conflicts
- Include appropriate error handling and loading states
