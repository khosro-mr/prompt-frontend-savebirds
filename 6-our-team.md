# 4. Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop View**:
  - Grid layout with 4 cards per row on large screens
  - Adequate spacing between cards
  - Consistent card heights

- **Medium Screen View**:
  - Grid layout with 2 cards per row
  - Maintained spacing and alignment

- **Mobile View**:
  - Single-column layout (1 card per row)
  - Full-width cards with appropriate padding
  - Scrollable view with properly sized elements for touch interaction

# 5. Implementation Notes
- Create as a Vue component in `views/OurTeamView.vue`
- Create a reusable TeamMemberCard component in `components/team/TeamMemberCard.vue`
- Use Bootstrap 5 grid system for responsive layout
- Use Bootstrap's card component as a base for the team member cards
- Store team member data in a separate data file or as a computed property
- Ensure all profile images are properly optimized for web (compressed without significant quality loss)
- Implement accessibility features for all interactive elements
- Add hover effects for a better user experience

# 6. Component Data Structure
```javascript
// Team member data structure
const teamMembers = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Mostafa M. Rezaee",
    position: "Ph.D. Candidate",
    department: "Data Science Program",
    organization: "Bowling Green State University",
    image: "images/team/mostafa-rezaee.jpg",
    links: {
      website: "https://mostafa-mr.com/",
      email: "rezaeem@bgsu.edu",
      linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-m-rezaee/",
      googleScholar: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jvcCIJYAAAAJ&hl=en"
    }
  },
  // Additional team members...
]
```

# 7. Code Structure
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Implement as a single-file component with template, script, and style sections
- Style using Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS
- For any custom styles, use scoped CSS to avoid conflicts
- Use v-for directive to iterate through team member data
- Implement appropriate conditional rendering for links (only show links that exist)

# 8. Technical Considerations
- Preload profile images for better performance
- Implement lazy loading for images that are not in the initial viewport
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP with JPEG fallback) for optimal loading
- Ensure all links open in a new tab with proper rel attributes for security
- Use Bootstrap Icons for social media icons
- Ensure consistent sizing of profile photos by standardizing dimensions before implementation
