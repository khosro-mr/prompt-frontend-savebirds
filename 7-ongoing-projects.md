# 4. Image Resources and Implementation

## 4.1. Profile Images
- **Source**: Use team member images from the `/images/team/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `firstname-lastname.jpg` (all lowercase, hyphenated)
- **Format**: Square images cropped to circular display using CSS
- **Resolution**: 300x300px minimum (higher for retina displays)
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web without significant quality loss
- **Styling**: Apply circular style with CSS `border-radius: 50%`
- **Accessibility**: Include appropriate alt text for all images

## 4.2. Project Icons
- **Source**: Use document/file icons from `/images/icons/` directory
- **Format**: SVG preferred for scalability
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent sizing across all project cards
- **Contrast**: Ensure good visibility against the green card background

# 5. Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop View**:
  - Full-width project cards
  - Team member mini-cards: 4-5 per row depending on available space
  - Comfortable spacing between elements

- **Medium Screen View**:
  - Full-width project cards
  - Team member mini-cards: 3 per row
  - Adapted spacing for readability

- **Mobile View**:
  - Full-width project cards
  - Team member mini-cards: 1-2 per row
  - Increased vertical spacing for touch-friendly interaction
  - Text size adjusted for readability on smaller screens

# 6. Implementation Notes
- Create as a Vue component in `views/OngoingProjectsView.vue`
- Create reusable components:
  - `components/projects/ProjectCard.vue`
  - `components/projects/TeamMemberMiniCard.vue`
- Use Bootstrap 5 grid system for responsive layout
- Store project and team member data in separate data files or as computed properties
- Implement conditional rendering for links and social media icons
- Use v-for directives to iterate through projects and team members
- Ensure all external links open in new tabs with appropriate security attributes

# 7. Component Data Structure
```javascript
// Projects data structure
const projects = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "SaveBirds.app: A web tool for analyzing the North American Breeding Bird Survey data to enhance conservation in protected areas",
    externalLink: "https://example.com/project1", // Replace with actual link
    teamMembers: [1, 2, 3, 4] // IDs referencing teamMembers array
  },
  // Additional projects...
];

// Team members data structure (including those from Our Team page plus additional members)
const teamMembers = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Mostafa M. Rezaee",
    position: "Ph.D. Candidate",
    department: "Data Science Program",
    organization: "Bowling Green State University",
    image: "images/team/mostafa-rezaee.jpg",
    links: {
      website: "https://mostafa-mr.com/",

      googleScholar: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jvcCIJYAAAAJ&hl=en"
    }
  },
  // Additional team members...
];
```

# 8. Code Structure
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Implement as single-file components with template, script, and style sections
- Style using Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS
- For any custom styles, use scoped CSS to avoid conflicts
- Implement appropriate conditional rendering for optional elements
- Use computed properties to filter team members for each project
- Include appropriate comments for complex logic
