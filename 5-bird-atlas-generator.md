<h1 align="center">SaveBirds.app Bird Atlas Generator (BAG)</h1>

# 1. Overview
Create the Bird Atlas Generator (BAG) page for SaveBirds.app using Vue 3 and Bootstrap 5. This tool allows users to generate comprehensive bird atlases for specific geographic areas and time periods, providing valuable insights for conservation and research efforts.

# 2. Design Requirements

## 2.1. Layout Structure
The Bird Atlas Generator page should consist of three main sections:
- **Explanation Section**: Title and descriptive text explaining the feature
- **Form Inputs Section**: User selection controls for data parameters
- **Map Viewer Section**: Interactive map display with controls

## 2.2. Visual Reference

# 4. Interaction Flow

## 4.1. User Input Phase
1. User selects a start year from the dropdown
2. User selects an end year from the dropdown (must be ≥ start year)
3. User selects a geographic area option
4. User clicks the "Click" button to initiate the process

## 4.2. Map Visualization Phase
1. The appropriate geographic boundaries are displayed on the map based on the selected area
2. Map is interactive, allowing zoom, pan, and exploration of boundaries
3. User can click the "Click to get results!" button to generate the final atlas

## 4.3. Results Phase
1. The system generates a comprehensive bird atlas for the selected parameters
2. Results are displayed or made available for download

# 5. Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop View**:
  - Optimal layout with balanced sections
  - Map spans full width with appropriate height
  - All controls easily accessible without scrolling

- **Mobile View**:
  - Single-column layout with sections stacked vertically
  - Form inputs may use accordion or collapsible sections if needed
  - Map sized appropriately for mobile viewing
  - All interactive elements sized appropriately for touch input

# 6. Implementation Notes
- Create as a Vue component in `views/BirdAtlasGeneratorView.vue`
- Use Bootstrap 5 grid system for responsive layout
- Implement form controls using Vue's v-model for data binding
- Use Leaflet.js library for the interactive map (vue-leaflet can be considered)
- Ensure proper validation of form inputs before submission
- Implement loading indicators for map data retrieval
- Since this is a frontend-only implementation, mock the data visualization with static map examples

# 7. Data Handling
- Implement client-side validation for all form inputs
- Handle the synchronization between start and end year dropdowns
- Structure the component to emit events or call store actions on form submission
- Create mock data for different geographic areas to display on the map

# 8. Component Data Structure
```javascript
data() {
  return {
    startYear: 1966,
    endYear: 2022,  // Update to current year
    geographicArea: "BCR", // Default selection
    isLoading: false,
    mapReady: false,
    resultsReady: false,
    // Additional data properties as needed for map functionality
  }
}
```

# 9. Code Structure
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<section>`, `<form>`, etc.)
- Implement as a single-file component with template, script, and style sections
- Style using Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS
- Create smaller sub-components for complex form sections if needed
- Include appropriate comments for complex logic
- For any custom styles, use scoped CSS to avoid conflicts
